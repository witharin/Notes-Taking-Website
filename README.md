# Notes-Taking-Website
Created a Notes taking website using HTML &amp; Javascript

Project Explanation:- 

The project I'm builded a “Note Taking Website App Using Pure JavaScript.” We all have a notes app on our mobiles or laptop. Note-taking websites are the online equivalent of notebooks, and because they are digital, they can do more for me than paper ever could. I can even build a more advanced level note-taking website, but I will keep it simple for now.

The Web-Sites looks like:-
